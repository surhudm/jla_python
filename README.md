# jla_python

Python bindings for JLA code (Betoule et al. 2014) to fit SN light curves

The original code was downloaded from:

http://supernovae.in2p3.fr/sdss_snls_jla/ReadMe.html

I have added swig files and the python wrappers for the JLA code and added in example code which shows how to perform the cosmological analysis from the JLA sample.
